1. In MVC once the action is selected the binding model (if applicable) is generated based on
 the incoming request

2. There are several factors that MVC middleware can find the controller classes in runtime:
	a. They have controller name at the end of their name
	b. Inherit from Controller or ControllerBase class
	c. Another convention is to put all your controller in the Controller folder(
		It is not required for middleware)

3. Any PUBLIC method in a controller can be a action.

4. In a MVC application any action normally returns ViewResult or RedirectResult(
	It has Redirect helper function).

5. Action methods normally shouldn't perform any business logic,
 instead they should call appropriate services from application model.
